# Portfolio Discovery Capture

When doing discovery (brand direction, UX decisions, tech choices, research):

1. **Add notes** to `docs/portfolio/discovery-notes.md` with:
   - Date
   - Decision or finding
   - Rationale
   - Key choices

2. **Save artifacts** (wireframes, mood boards, sketches) to `docs/portfolio/artifacts/` and reference them in discovery notes

3. **Before starting major features**, consider: "What would a client want to see in a case study?" Document that thinking.
