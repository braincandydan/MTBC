# Portfolio Case Study Maintenance

After each significant milestone, update `docs/portfolio/CASE_STUDY_DRAFT.md` with:

- **What was built**: Brief description of the completed work
- **Key decisions**: Rationale and trade-offs worth highlighting
- **Screenshots/links**: Add placeholder paths or URLs (e.g., `[screenshot: hero-mobile]`) if not yet available

Use the structure: Problem / Approach / Solution / Results / Tech Stack.

The draft should stay current so it's ready to finalize when the project goes live. Do not wait until the end to write the case study.
