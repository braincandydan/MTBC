# Portfolio Milestone Tracker

When completing a feature or fix that maps to an MVP item in `docs/portfolio/MVP_CHECKLIST.md`:

1. **Update the checklist**: Mark the corresponding item complete (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
2. **Capture evidence**: Add screenshot path, URL, or brief note in the Evidence column
3. **Log decisions**: If significant trade-offs were made, add a note to the relevant `docs/portfolio/*.md` file (e.g., `01-technical-responsiveness.md`)

MVP items map to: responsive design, performance, accessibility, SEO, cart/checkout, error states, clean code, design polish, imagery, branding, case study, live demo, discovery artifacts, tech stack.
